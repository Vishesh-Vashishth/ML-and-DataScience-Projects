Explanation of Flow
Normal Distribution: Used in cases where data is symmetric around a mean. Algorithms like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression assume normality.

Bernoulli Distribution: Deals with binary outcomes. Logistic Regression and Decision Trees are often applied in binary classification problems where data may follow a Bernoulli pattern.

Binomial Distribution: Used for counting the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, with applications in Naive Bayes and classification models.

Poisson Distribution: Handles count data over time or space, often used with Poisson Regression in count-based problems.

Exponential Distribution: Models time until an event occurs. Survival Analysis is a field that leverages this distribution to predict wait times or event intervals.

Uniform Distribution: When all values within a range are equally likely, randomized algorithms and uniform sampling can use this pattern.

Log-Normal Distribution: For positively skewed data (where values can't be negative), such as incomes. Neural Networks and financial models work with log-normal data.

Gamma Distribution: Used for events with multiple stages, applicable in reliability testing and survival analysis.

Beta Distribution: Perfect for proportions or ratios, useful in Bayesian inference and probabilistic models.

This flow diagram organizes distributions by typical machine learning applications, making it easier to remember which distributions and algorithms go together.
